Patient Note:

Patient Name: Carlos García
Patient ID: 882299
Age: 44
Location: Spain

Subjective: Carlos García, a 44-year-old male, presents with fever, fatigue, and muscle aches for the past week. He also reports experiencing chills, sweats, and headaches. Carlos mentions a recent trip to a rural area in northern Spain where he spent time outdoors. He recalls being bitten by a tick during his trip. He denies any recent respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms. Carlos has no significant past medical history but is concerned about his persistent symptoms.

Objective: Vital signs: BP 125/80 mmHg, HR 90 bpm, Temp 38.5°C, RR 18/min. Physical examination reveals mild pallor and generalized tenderness in his muscles. No lymphadenopathy is noted. Cardiovascular and respiratory exams are unremarkable. Laboratory tests show hemolytic anemia with a low hemoglobin level (9.5 g/dL), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and low platelet count (110,000/μL). Blood smear reveals intraerythrocytic parasites consistent with Babesia species. Liver and renal function tests are within normal limits.

Assessment: Carlos is diagnosed with babesiosis based on his symptoms of fever, fatigue, recent tick exposure, and the presence of Babesia parasites in his blood smear. His hemolytic anemia and low platelet count are consistent with the disease.

Plan: Initiate treatment with a combination of atovaquone 750 mg orally twice daily and azithromycin 500 mg on the first day, followed by 250 mg daily for 7-10 days. Monitor Carlos for signs of worsening anemia and consider blood transfusion if necessary. Advise him to avoid strenuous activity and to stay hydrated. Schedule follow-up blood tests in 1 week to monitor for resolution of the infection and improvement of anemia. Educate Carlos on tick bite prevention, including the use of insect repellent and protective clothing during outdoor activities. Arrange a follow-up visit in 2 weeks to assess response to treatment.
