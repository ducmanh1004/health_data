Patient Note:

Patient Name: Fatima Ahmed
Patient ID: 556677
Age: 62
Location: Yemen

Subjective: Fatima Ahmed, a 62-year-old female, presents with persistent fatigue, joint pain, and skin rash over the past two months. She describes the joint pain as aching and swelling primarily in her knees and hands. The rash, which began on her scalp and has spread to her elbows and knees, is itchy and scaling. Fatima reports difficulty walking due to joint discomfort and mentions that the rash has not improved with over-the-counter treatments. She also notes a recent loss of appetite and unintentional weight loss. Fatima has a history of high blood pressure and is currently on antihypertensive medication.

Objective: Vital signs: BP 140/85 mmHg, HR 76 bpm, Temp 36.9Â°C, RR 18/min. Physical examination reveals erythematous, scaly plaques on the scalp, elbows, and knees consistent with psoriasis. The knees show bilateral swelling and tenderness. There is no acute inflammation or redness in other joints. Laboratory tests show an elevated ESR of 30 mm/hr and normal CRP. A skin biopsy confirms psoriasis. Rheumatoid factor is negative, and joint X-rays show no erosive changes.

Assessment: Fatima is diagnosed with psoriasis with associated psoriatic arthritis. The skin findings and joint symptoms are consistent with this diagnosis. The elevated ESR suggests some inflammatory component, though rheumatoid arthritis is unlikely given the negative rheumatoid factor and normal X-ray findings.

Plan: Initiate treatment with topical corticosteroids (clobetasol propionate 0.05%) for the psoriasis, applied twice daily to affected areas. Recommend a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (naproxen 500 mg twice daily) for joint pain relief. Advise Fatima to use emollients to manage skin dryness and reduce irritation. Refer her to a dermatologist for further management of psoriasis and a rheumatologist for evaluation and management of psoriatic arthritis if symptoms persist. Schedule a follow-up appointment in 6 weeks to monitor treatment effectiveness and adjust therapy as needed. Discuss lifestyle modifications, including stress management and a balanced diet, to improve overall health and manage symptoms.
