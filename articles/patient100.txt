Patient Note:

Patient Name: Emily Johnson
Patient ID: 223344
Age: 18

Subjective: Emily Johnson, an 18-year-old female, presents with increasing stiffness and pain in her neck and shoulders over the past year. She reports limited movement in her arms and occasional flare-ups of painful swelling in various joints, particularly after minor trauma or viral illnesses. Her parents noticed restricted mobility in her big toes since early childhood, but the stiffness has progressed more rapidly during adolescence. Emily denies any history of fractures, but there is a significant history of swelling in soft tissues.

Objective: Vital signs: BP 120/78 mmHg, HR 75 bpm, Temp 36.5Â°C, RR 16/min. On physical examination, there is noticeable limited range of motion in the neck and shoulders. Palpable, firm masses are present in the upper back and shoulder regions, consistent with heterotopic bone formation. No acute signs of infection or inflammation are noted. Radiographic imaging confirms multiple areas of ectopic ossification in the neck, back, and shoulder regions.

Assessment: Emily is diagnosed with Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP), characterized by progressive heterotopic ossification and congenital malformation of the great toes. Her symptoms align with the typical presentation of FOP, including the flare-ups after minor trauma and noticeable bone formation in soft tissues.

Plan: Recommend avoidance of activities that could cause trauma or lead to flare-ups. Prescribe a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) for pain management during flare-ups. Discuss genetic counseling options with Emily and her family to better understand the condition. Refer her to an orthopedic specialist for monitoring of joint mobility and bone growth. Advise against any surgical procedures, as they could exacerbate ossification. Schedule a follow-up appointment in 3 months to assess progression and pain control.
