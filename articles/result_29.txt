Patient Note:

Patient Name: Hiroshi Takahashi
Patient ID: 998822
Age: 48
Location: Japan

Subjective: Hiroshi Takahashi, a 48-year-old male, presents with complaints of frequent heartburn, regurgitation, and a bitter taste in his mouth over the past three months. He reports that the symptoms worsen after meals, especially when lying down or bending over. Hiroshi has also experienced occasional chest discomfort but denies any difficulty swallowing, weight loss, or vomiting. He has been taking over-the-counter antacids with minimal relief. He has a history of hypertension but no known allergies or prior gastrointestinal issues.

Objective: Vital signs: BP 135/85 mmHg, HR 78 bpm, Temp 37.2Â°C, RR 16/min. Physical examination reveals mild tenderness in the epigastric region upon palpation. There is no abdominal distension, and bowel sounds are normal. No jaundice or pallor is noted. Laboratory results, including complete blood count and liver function tests, are within normal limits. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy shows signs of erosive esophagitis but no ulcers or masses.

Assessment: Hiroshi is diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) based on his symptoms of heartburn, regurgitation, and the findings of erosive esophagitis on endoscopy. His symptoms are consistent with chronic acid reflux.

Plan: Initiate treatment with a proton pump inhibitor (omeprazole 20 mg daily) for 8 weeks to reduce acid production and promote healing of the esophagus. Advise Hiroshi to avoid trigger foods such as spicy, fatty, and acidic foods, as well as caffeine and alcohol. Recommend elevating the head of the bed and avoiding lying down for at least 2 hours after meals. Encourage weight loss if necessary and smoking cessation. Schedule a follow-up appointment in 4 weeks to assess symptom improvement and adjust treatment if needed. If symptoms persist, consider further evaluation with a 24-hour pH monitoring test.
