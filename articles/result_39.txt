Patient Note:

Patient Name: Manuel Almeida
Patient ID: 554488
Age: 52
Location: Portugal

Subjective: Manuel Almeida, a 52-year-old male, presents with fatigue, palpitations, and intermittent chest pain over the past few months. He also reports shortness of breath with mild exertion and occasional swelling in his legs. Manuel mentions that he lived in Brazil for several years before moving to Portugal and recalls being bitten by insects frequently during his time there. He denies any recent fever, weight loss, or gastrointestinal symptoms. He has no significant medical history but is concerned about his worsening symptoms.

Objective: Vital signs: BP 130/85 mmHg, HR 88 bpm, Temp 36.7Â°C, RR 18/min. Physical examination reveals mild edema in both lower extremities and jugular venous distention. The cardiac exam shows an irregular rhythm with no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation. An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows conduction abnormalities, including right bundle branch block. A chest X-ray reveals mild cardiomegaly. Blood tests show mild anemia, and serology for Trypanosoma cruzi is positive, confirming Chagas disease. Echocardiogram reveals left ventricular dilation with reduced ejection fraction.

Assessment: Manuel is diagnosed with chronic Chagas disease, with evidence of cardiac involvement, including cardiomyopathy and conduction abnormalities. His history of living in an endemic area and positive serology for Trypanosoma cruzi support the diagnosis.

Plan: Refer Manuel to a cardiologist for management of Chagas-related cardiomyopathy. Start him on an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (enalapril 5 mg daily) and a beta-blocker (carvedilol 6.25 mg twice daily) to improve heart function and control symptoms. Monitor for signs of heart failure, and recommend lifestyle modifications such as reducing salt intake and avoiding strenuous activity. Consider antiparasitic treatment with benznidazole, especially if early-stage disease is confirmed, after consultation with an infectious disease specialist. Schedule a follow-up appointment in 4 weeks to assess his response to treatment and monitor for any progression of cardiac disease.
