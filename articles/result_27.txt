Patient Note:

Patient Name: Aisha Ahmed
Patient ID: 992211
Age: 32
Location: Yemen

Subjective: Aisha Ahmed, a 32-year-old female, presents with complaints of persistent burning sensation in her chest, particularly after meals, along with frequent burping and regurgitation of food for the past six months. She reports that these symptoms worsen when lying down or after eating spicy or fatty foods. She denies any weight loss, vomiting, or blood in her stool. Aisha also experiences occasional nausea but no abdominal pain. She has no history of similar gastrointestinal issues and no known food allergies. Her family history is negative for gastrointestinal diseases.

Objective: Vital signs: BP 120/75 mmHg, HR 78 bpm, Temp 36.9Â°C, RR 16/min. Physical examination reveals mild tenderness in the epigastric region upon palpation but no guarding or rebound tenderness. No jaundice, hepatomegaly, or abdominal distension is observed. Laboratory tests, including complete blood count and liver function tests, are normal. Upper GI endoscopy shows mild esophagitis and a small hiatal hernia, consistent with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

Assessment: Aisha is diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), based on her symptoms of heartburn, regurgitation, and the endoscopic findings of esophagitis. The presence of a small hiatal hernia likely contributes to her symptoms.

Plan: Initiate proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy with omeprazole 20 mg once daily before breakfast for 8 weeks to reduce gastric acid secretion. Advise lifestyle modifications, including elevating the head of the bed, avoiding late meals, and avoiding trigger foods such as spicy and fatty foods. Recommend weight management and regular small meals to prevent reflux. Schedule a follow-up in 4 weeks to assess the effectiveness of treatment and adjust the dose if needed. If symptoms persist, consider further diagnostic studies, such as 24-hour pH monitoring.
