Patient Note:

Patient Name: Fatima Abdullah
Patient ID: 998877
Age: 36
Location: Yemen

Subjective: Fatima Abdullah, a 36-year-old female, presents with complaints of frequent heartburn, regurgitation of food, and a sour taste in her mouth for the past three months. She reports that symptoms worsen after eating large meals or lying down. Fatima occasionally experiences chest discomfort but denies any nausea, vomiting, or weight loss. She has been self-medicating with antacids, which provide temporary relief. She has no history of similar symptoms and no significant family history of gastrointestinal disorders.

Objective: Vital signs: BP 120/80 mmHg, HR 72 bpm, Temp 36.9Â°C, RR 16/min. Physical examination reveals mild tenderness on palpation in the epigastric region. No abdominal masses or organomegaly are noted. Bowel sounds are normal, and there is no evidence of jaundice or ascites. Laboratory tests, including a complete blood count and basic metabolic panel, are within normal limits. An upper endoscopy shows mild esophagitis and a small hiatal hernia.

Assessment: Fatima is diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), based on her symptoms of heartburn, regurgitation, and the findings of esophagitis on endoscopy. Her symptoms are consistent with chronic acid reflux exacerbated by her eating habits.

Plan: Initiate treatment with a proton pump inhibitor (omeprazole 20 mg once daily before breakfast) for 4-8 weeks to reduce gastric acid production. Advise lifestyle modifications, including eating smaller, more frequent meals, avoiding spicy and fatty foods, and not lying down immediately after eating. Recommend elevating the head of her bed to prevent nighttime reflux. Educate on the importance of weight management, as obesity can exacerbate GERD symptoms. Schedule a follow-up in 6 weeks to assess symptom control and adjust treatment if necessary.
