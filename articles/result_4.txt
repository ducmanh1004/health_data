Patient Note:

Patient Name: John Smith
Patient ID: 789123
Age: 62

Subjective: John Smith, a 62-year-old male, presents with severe chest pain that began suddenly about two hours ago. He describes the pain as a heavy, squeezing sensation in the center of his chest, radiating to his left arm and jaw. He also reports shortness of breath, sweating, and nausea. John has a history of hypertension and high cholesterol, for which he takes medications, but admits he has not been consistent with his prescriptions. He has no prior history of heart attacks or coronary artery disease. There is a family history of cardiovascular disease; his father had a heart attack in his early 60s.

Objective: Vital signs: BP 150/90 mmHg, HR 110 bpm, RR 22/min, Temp 37.2Â°C, O2 saturation 94% on room air. The patient appears anxious and diaphoretic. Cardiovascular examination reveals an elevated heart rate with no murmurs or gallops. Lungs are clear on auscultation. No peripheral edema is noted. Electrocardiogram (ECG) shows ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF, consistent with an inferior myocardial infarction. Blood tests reveal elevated troponin I levels at 0.9 ng/mL (normal <0.04 ng/mL), confirming myocardial injury.

Assessment: John is diagnosed with an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), specifically an inferior STEMI, based on his symptoms of chest pain, ECG findings, and elevated cardiac biomarkers.

Plan: Immediate treatment with dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 325 mg and clopidogrel 600 mg loading dose) and sublingual nitroglycerin for chest pain. Administer oxygen and morphine for pain management, and initiate intravenous heparin for anticoagulation. Arrange for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for coronary artery revascularization. Continue monitoring vital signs and cardiac rhythm. After PCI, continue long-term management with beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and statin therapy for secondary prevention. Advise strict adherence to medications and lifestyle changes to control blood pressure and cholesterol. Schedule follow-up with cardiology in one week.
